Learning the basics of MongoDB
To use this interface run the 'npm install' command from in the dir the with the package.json file


This is a basic interface that uses MongoDB for storing different products that could be sold by a farmer on a roadside shop.

There is no styles yet applied to this application, and the functionality is very limited. This is the first application I made while learning how to use a database
while doing a full stack web developer course. More functionality will be added in the future, as well as styling.
